# Metablok
## Inspiration

With the development of technology, the digitalization needs of brands are increasing day by day. Most of the brands open their stores and make sales on the internet. With the development of the metaverse over time, we think that there will be no brands that do not open a store in environments such as the metaverse. Especially in the metaverse environment, where visual perception increases and product inspection opportunities are moved to a different dimension We believe that the pleasure of shopping will be different. The number of vr glasses is increasing day by day and people have started to spend more time in the metaverse. As a shopping experience in the future, we think that the products can be purchased by examining the products in much more detail in the 3D environment, and even an experience similar to the physical shopping experience in the metaverse shopping centers can be given over time.We think that instead of selling land in Metaverse, establishing an open-air mall and selling empty shops in different sizes may be a more beneficial solution for companies. Moreover, in the following stages, each brand will be able to design the store itself with our store designer editor tool.

On this platform, the experience of logging into the system with our own digital twin avatars, trying on different clothes on our avatar and purchasing with ICP coin is offered.

In addition, we believe that cryptocurrencies will be used more widely in payments over time and crypto reward mechanisms will become widespread especially in internet shopping. All these are the factors that push us to do this project.

## What it does

Metablok is a platform where brands can buy or rent empty shops in the metaverse, display their products in 3D environment, open them for sale and sell with crypto money. You can enter the system with your own digital twin avatar and talk other avatars with your voice.You can try different clothes with your avatar and buy with ICP. Moreover the platform will be play&earn game platform. Every avatar will enter the games(basketball,tennis etc) and earn metablok tokens.

## How we built it

Barış Baran designed an open-air mall and stores with Blender, two of our friends (Resul,Dr Alper and Beytullah) made the developments on the Unity Framework side and then created a multiplayer environment with the Photon framework. Beytullah added virtual dressing functionality to our system. Resul also developed avatar based-system with avatar-sdk. Haşim developed voice chat platform with Agora Voice SDK. Haşim & Mert and Hasan also dealt with blockchain developments and integrations, and we were able to release our first product in mvp.

## Challenges we ran into

-   Transferring a real-world object to the metaverse was a big challenge.
-   Optimization was a big challenge to overcome. WebGL is very unforgiving in this regard.
-   Character control and functionality problems in multiplayer.
-   Voice chat Agora-SDK integration was hard.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

-   Entering the system with the digital avatars we produced from our photos.
-   You can try and buy the clothes you choose in Metablok shops with your avatar.
-   Avatars can talk each other with voice.
-   Cross-platform support. We have connected both VR and WebGL in the same metaverse.
-   We took pictures of different real-life objects from different angles and transferred them to the metaverse. It was not an easy thing, but we were proud to see that we could do it.
-   3D animated model built from one selfie used by local compute SDK in MetaBlock.
-   For better optimization, we had to sacrifice a lot of the quality of the graphics. However, even after that, we believe we managed to create something that looks good

## What we learned

-   How to create a cross-platform metaverse in Unity.
-   How to transfer any real-world object and yourself as an avatar to the metaverse and customize your avatars with wearables.
-   We learned how to use light baking and LOD (Level of Detail) right for better optimization.

## What's next for Metablok

-   We will develop the ICP Unity wallet plugin for VR glasses and ensure that transactions can be done without leaving the metaverse.
-   We are planning to open nft marketplace for our metaverse platform to sell and make auction on metaverse with our avatars. In this way, shops will be able to be sold over the nft market and the digital twins of the products will be auctioned between avatars.
-   We also want people to try on things like dresses and shoes and experience what they look like with their own avatar.
-   We also plan to use NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields and will optimize a neural representation for the custom real object and will build a 3D virtual object if we collect enough 3d object images. According to our knowledge, there is no AI model and SDK to convert from 2D to 3D because it needs training.
-   We want to turn metablok into an entertainment platform where different games can be played over VR. -We are planning to add traditional payment methods to the metaverse as well. (Square, masterpass etc.)
